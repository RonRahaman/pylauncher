This is a short example of interfacing the pylauncher
to another running application.

If you want to test this on your local machine:

1. Run the server in the background: "python server.py &"
2. Run the driver in the foreground: "python driver.py"
3. You'll see screen output where the server echoes the 
  incoming commands.
4. After completion, you can inspect the output that was caught:
  "cat pylauncher_tmpNone/out*"

TODO
- custom port
- instead of localhost, use process zero of the hostlist
- try returning results through the socket.
